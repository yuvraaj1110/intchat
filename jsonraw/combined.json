[Home](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/)\n2. **About SEVIS**\n\n## About SEVIS\n\nThe Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) is the web-based system that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) uses to maintain information regarding:\n\n- [Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified schools](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/getting-started-with-sevp-certification).\n- F-1 and M-1 students studying in the United States (and their F-2 and M-2 dependents).\n- U.S. Department of State-designated Exchange Visitor Program sponsors.\n- J-1 visa Exchange Visitor Program participants (and their J-2 dependents).\n\nOn behalf of DHS, SEVP manages SEVIS. The system is a critical tool in SEVP’s mission to protect national security while supporting the legal entry and stay of the more than one million F, M and J nonimmigrants coming to the United States for educational and cultural exchange programs.\n\n## SEVP-Certified Schools and SEVIS\n\nU.S. schools apply for [SEVP certification](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/getting-started-with-sevp-certification) by using SEVIS to submit their initial [Form I-17, “Petition for Approval of School for Attendance by Nonimmigrant Student.”](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/tutorial-a-guide-to-completing-the-form-i-17) If SEVP accepts the school’s Form I-17 and grants it certification, the school may begin using SEVIS to issue [Forms I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status,](http://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/student-forms?form=Forms_I-20)” to nonimmigrant F and M students and their accompanying dependents.\n\nOnce certified, principal designated school officials use SEVIS to update their school’s Form I-17 and apply for SEVP [recertification](http://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/schools/recertification) every two years. Additionally, designated school officials at SEVP-certified schools use SEVIS to:\n\n- Fulfill the school’s legal reporting responsibility regarding student addresses, courses of study, enrollment, employment and compliance with the terms of F and M student status.\n- Transfer F and M student SEVIS records to other institutions.\n\nSchool officials can find SEVIS resources, including step-by-step guides, video demonstrations and updates about SEVIS enhancements and webinars, on the [SEVIS Help Hub](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/sevis-help-hub).\n\n## Exchange Visitor Programs and SEVIS\n\nExchange Visitor programs use SEVIS to petition the U.S. Department of State for designation that allows the sponsor to offer educational and cultural exchange programs to exchange visitors. Responsible officers (ROs) of designated Exchange Visitor Programs use SEVIS to:\n\n- Update sponsor information and apply for re-designation every two years.\n- Issue Forms DS-2019, “Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor (J-1) Status,” to nonimmigrants to obtain J status.\n- Fulfill the sponsor’s legal reporting responsibility regarding exchange visitor addresses, sites of activity, program participation, employment and compliance with the terms of J status.\n- Transfer exchange visitor SEVIS records to other institutions.\n\nROs and alternate responsible officers can find more information about how SEVIS relates to their responsibilities by visiting the [U.S. Department of State’s website](https://j1visa.state.gov/sponsors/current/sevis/ \"(opens in a new window)\").\n\nFor more information about SEVIS, including its history and specific guidance for federal SEVIS users, please visit [ICE.gov/SEVIS](https://www.ice.gov/sevis/overview \"(opens in a new window)\").\n\nRelated Tags: [SEVIS](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/filter?filter=47)\n\nWas This Helpful?\n\nPlease provide feedback on this page.\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nWhy wasn't this helpful?

[Home](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/)\n2. [Students](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students)\n3. **Change of Status**\n\n## Change of Status\n\nIf you want to change your status while in the United States, you (or in some cases your employer) must file a request with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on the appropriate form before your authorized stay expires.\n\nIn general, you may apply to change your nonimmigrant status if you were lawfully admitted to the United States in an eligible nonimmigrant status, your nonimmigrant status remains valid, you have not violated the conditions of your status and you have not committed any crimes that would make you ineligible. Until you receive approval from USCIS, do not assume the status has been approved and do not change your activity in the United States.\n\nUSCIS recommends that you apply as soon as you determine that you need to change to a different nonimmigrant classification. If USCIS denies your application, be prepared to leave the United States when your current status expires.\n\n## Changing to a Nonimmigrant Student Status\n\nYou may wish to change your [nonimmigrant status](http://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/Nonimmigrant%20Class%20Who%20Can%20Study.pdf \"(opens in a new window)\") if you are already in the United States on a valid nonimmigrant visa for a purpose other than attending school and want to study at a U.S. Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified school. You are not eligible for a change of status in the United States if you entered as a visitor through the visa waiver program.\n\nIf you meet the criteria above and want to change your status while you remain in the United States, you must submit an application with USCIS to change your nonimmigrant status by following these steps:\n\n- Apply to and receive acceptance from an [SEVP-certified school.](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/school-search/)\n- Obtain an initial [Form I-20, \"Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status,\"](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/student-forms?form=Forms_I-20) from the SEVP-certified school.\n- The designated school official (DSO) should give change of status in the Issue Reason section of the Form I-20.\n- Pay the [I-901 SEVIS Fee.](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/sevis-i-901-fee/)\n- File a [Form I-539, \"Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status,\"](https://www.uscis.gov/i-539 \"(opens in a new window)\") with USCIS.\n- Not all nonimmigrant classifications are eligible to change to student status. Read the instructions carefully to ensure that your nonimmigrant classification is eligible for a change of status.\n\n## Special Instructions for Changing to a Nonimmigrant Student Status from B-1/B-2 status\n\nIf you are changing status from B-1/B-2 to F or M student, refrain from enrolling in or beginning your studies until USCIS has approved your change of status. Enrolling in a course of study while in B-1/B-2 status, or any status that does not permit you to enroll in a program of study, will result in a status violation. If USCIS has not adjudicated your change of status at least 15 days before the program start date on your Form I-20, contact the DSO at your new school. You may need to wait to attend (have deferred attendance).\n\n## Instructions for Applicants for Change of Status to F-1 Nonimmigrant Student\n\nIf your nonimmigrant status is unexpired at the time of filing the application to change status to F-1 nonimmigrant, and you otherwise remain eligible for a change of status, you are not required to obtain status all the way up to the date that is 30 days before your program start date (“bridge the gap”). Even if USCIS processing times cause a delay in your program start date and your DSO must defer your start date until the next academic term or semester, you are not required to file any additional applications to maintain your status. If approved, your change of status to F-1 will be effective as of the date of adjudication.\n\nYou must wait until the change of status to F-1 application is approved and you are within 30 days of the new program start date to engage in F status-specific activities, such as on-campus employment and practical training.\n\n## Instructions for Applicants for a Change of Status to M-1 Nonimmigrant Student\n\nIf your current nonimmigrant status will expire more than 30 days before your M-1 program start date and you wish to remain in the United States until your start date, you must find a way to obtain status all the way up to the date that is 30 days before your program start date (“bridge the gap”).\n\nUSCIS may only approve your Form I-539 change of status request if you obtain status up to 30 days before your program’s initial start date.\n\nThis means you may need to file an additional Form I-539, with a separate fee, to request an extension of your current nonimmigrant status or change of status if:\n\n- Your current status will expire more than 30 days before the initial M-1 program start date. If you do not file an application to extend or change to another status before your current status expires, USCIS will deny your Form I-539 request to change to M-1 status. Please continue to check the [USCIS processing times](https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/ \"(opens in a new window)\") while your Form I-539 change of status request is pending to determine if you need to file a request to extend or change your nonimmigrant status.\n- Your M-1 program start date is deferred to the following academic term or semester because USCIS did not make a decision on your Form I-539 change of status application before your originally intended  M-1 program start date, and your nonimmigrant status expires more than 30 days before that program start date. You will need to obtain status all the way up to the date which is **30 days before your new program start date**. If you had already filed a Form I-539 to bridge the original gap, you may need to file another Form I-539 to bridge the new gap.\n\nBecause extending or changing nonimmigrant status to bridge the gap, and changing to M-1 status are two distinct benefits, you must pay a separate filing fee for each request, per the User Fee Statute, found at 31 U.S.C. 9701. For more information about this process, please visit USCIS [Changing to a Nonimmigrant F or M Student Status](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/students-and-employment/changing-to-a-nonimmigrant-f-or-m-student-status \"(opens in a new window)\").\n\n## Changing to H-1B Status\n\nIf you are an F-1 student interested in changing to [H-1B status](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/h-1b-status-and-the-cap-gap-extension), your prospective employer must sponsor you and file that petition. See pages on H-1B Status and cap gap for details.\n\n## Special Note for M-1 Students\n\nIf you are an M-1 student, you may not change to F status while you are in the United States. If you would like to attend school as an F-1 student, you will need to leave the United States, apply to an SEVP-certified school and receive a new Form I-20. You will also need to apply for a new visa at a U.S. [Embassy](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/glossary/E/#Embassy \"A Department of State office, usually located in a country’s capital city. F and M students visit embassies to apply for a visa to enter the United States.\") or [Consulate](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/glossary/C/#Consulate \"Department of State offices headed by a Consul General who reports to the U.S. ambassador, which carry out many of the same functions in provincial or regional capitals as the embassies do in national capitals. F and M students can visit a consulate to ap\"), if applicable. In addition, if you are an M-1 student, you may not change to H status (temporary worker) if the education or training you received as a vocational student in the United States provided the qualifications for the temporary worker position you seek.\n\n## Alternative Option\n\nIf you are currently in the United States for a purpose other than attending school and would like to become a student, you may also decide to leave the United States, apply for a visa, if applicable, and re-enter as an F-1 or M-1 student. You will need to do the following:\n\n- Apply to and receive acceptance from an [SEVP-certified school](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/school-search/).\n- Receive a new initial Form I-20 from your designated school official (DSO).\n- Pay the [I-901 SEVIS Fee](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/sevis-i-901-fee/).\n- Apply at a U.S. consulate or embassy for an F-1 or M-1 [visa to travel to the United States](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/getting-a-visa/).\n- If you are from a country where no visa is required, such as Canada, you may proceed directly to a U.S. port of entry or a U.S. pre-clearance/pre-flight inspection station and apply for admission to the United States as an F-1 or M-1 student.\n- Once admitted by an immigration officer in F-1 or M-1 status, you may begin your studies.\n\nFor more information about consular processing, please visit the [Department of State Student Visa page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study/student-visa.html \"(opens in a new window)\").\n\nRelated Tags: [Resources](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/filter?filter=45), [Change of Status](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/filter?filter=68)\n\nStudent Resources Navigation\n\n- [Get Started](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/complete/change-of-status)  -

Paying the I-901 SEVIS fee is an important step in the process of applying for a student visa.\n\nAll prospective F and M students must pay the I-901 SEVIS fee to [apply for a visa](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/getting-a-visa) to enter the United States. If you are from a country that participates in the [Visa Waiver Program,](http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/without/without_1990.html#countries \"(opens in a new window)\") you must still pay the fee before you enter the country.\n\nIf you are in the United States on a valid nonimmigrant visa for a purpose other than attending school, and you are [changing your status](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/change-of-status) to F or M, you must also pay the fee.\n\nAdditionally, you may need to pay the fee if you are applying for reinstatement of student status or if you have been out of the United States for more than five months.\n\nIf you are unsure whether you need to pay the I-901 fee again, talk with your designated school official before you apply to extend your student status, transfer to another school, receive authorization for [optional practical training,](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/resources/working) or receive a new visa for your current course of study.\n\nTo pay the I-901 SEVIS fee, go to [FMJfee.com](https://fmjfee.com/i901fee/index.html \"(opens in a new window)\"). Once you pay your fee, you must print your receipt from FMJfee.com. You will use it as proof of payment and you should take it with you to your visa appointment and when you travel to the United States.\n\nIf you have questions, you can call the SEVP Response Center at 703-603-3400. SEVP answers this number from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday. At other times, you may leave a message and an SEVP representative will return your call.\n\nWas This Helpful?\n\nPlease provide feedback on this page.\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nWhy wasn't this helpful?

[Students](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students)\n3. **Students and the Form I-20**\n\n## Students and the Form I-20\n\nAll F and M students that study in the United States need a [Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.”](http://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/student-forms?form=Forms_I-20) Once accepted into a [Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified school](http://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/school-search), nonimmigrant students will receive a Form I-20 from their [designated school official (DSO)](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/node/333484).\n\nYou must also obtain a Form I-20 for any eligible dependents you plan to bring to the United States with you. However, please note that the name (i.e., Academic and Language students vs. Vocational Students) on the Form I-20 an SEVP-certified school issues you will dictate the type of student visa you may obtain from the U.S. Department of State and the status you will need to maintain in the United States. You and your DSO must both sign the Form I-20. If you are under age 18, your parents must sign the Form I-20 for you.\n\n### Form I-20 Uses\n\nThe Form I-20 is an important document that you should keep safe, as you will need it throughout the F and M student life cycle.\n\n#### Paying the I-901 SEVIS Fee\n\nBefore you pay the I-901 Student and [Exchange Visitor](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/glossary/E/#Exchange%20Visitor \"<p>A nonimmigrant in J-1 visa status. This classification is for individuals approved to participate in work- and study-based exchange visitor programs. All J-1 nonimmigrants must be sponsored by an organization that is designated by the Department of Sta\") Information System (SEVIS) Fee, you must receive the Form I-20 from a DSO at the school you plan to attend. You will need information from the Form I-20 to pay the fee. The [I-901 SEVIS Fee](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/glossary/I/#I-901%20SEVIS%20Fee \"A fee that all F and M students and J exchange visitors must pay before the Department of State can issue a visa. Students pay this fee after receiving their Form I-20, \") is mandatory and must be paid before you enter the United States.\n\nIn order to pay the I-901 SEVIS fee, all prospective F and M students will need to provide their:\n\n- Name, address, date of birth and email address.\n- Country of birth and country of citizenship.\n- School Code as listed on the Form I-20 “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.”\n- SEVIS Identification Number as listed on the Form I-20.\n\n#### Applying for a nonimmigrant visa\n\nThe Form I-20 lists your program start date, 30 days before which you are allowed to enter the United States. [F-1 and M-1 student visas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study.html \"(opens in a new window)\") can be issued up to 365 days in advance of your course of study start date. Your type of student visa must match the type of Form I-20 you have (e.g., F-1 or M-1). You are expected to have the original Form I-20 at your visa interview. The consular officer may accept a copy of the Form I-20 in limited circumstances that warrant visa issuance prior to you receiving the original Form I-20.\n\n#### Entering the United States\n\nYou are expected to have the signed Form I-20 on hand as you enter the country. Do not pack it away in your suitcase. A [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](http://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/about/cbp) officer will instruct you to present your Form I-20 at the [port of entry](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/node/333530). You may arrive up to 30 days before the start date listed on your Form I-20; or\n\n#### Changing status to F or M while in the United States\n\nYou need a Form I-20 if you are already in the United States as another type of nonimmigrant and you are applying to USCIS to change your status to F or M.\n\n#### Applying for benefits\n\nYour Form I-20 proves that you are legally enrolled in a program of study in the United States. Therefore, it may be needed when you apply for the benefits available to F and M students. If you are eligible to apply for a [driver’s license](http://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/resources/driving) or a [social security number](http://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/resources/social-security-number), remember to bring your Form I-20 with you.\n\n### When to Get a New Form I-20\n\nAfter receiving the initial Form I-20 upon program acceptance, students may receive a new Form I-20 from their DSO in the following circumstances:\n\n- If the physical copy of the form is destroyed or misplaced.\n- For travel endorsement.\n- When the student’s SEVIS status changes (e.g., from Initial to Active).\n- For any substantive change to student information, such as changes to a student’s personal information, program of study, optional practical training, etc.\n\n### Redesigned Form I-20\n\nAs of July 1, 2016, the [redesigned](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/2015/08/students-learn-how-the-redesigned-form-i-20-affects-you) [Form I-20](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/sevis-help-hub/student-records/sample-form-i-20) is required for all F and M nonimmigrant visa applications, entry into the United States, travel and applications for nonimmigrant benefits. The previous version of the Form I-20 (with a barcode) is now invalid. Students please note that your DSOs were responsible for providing an updated, hard copy of the Form I-20 with original signatures to all F-1 and M-1 students at their schools.\n\nRelated Tags: [Form I-20](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/filter?filter=31)\n\nStudent Resources Navigation\n\n- [Get Started](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/prepare/students-and-the-form-i-20)  -

[Students](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students)\n3. **Getting to the United States**\n\n## Getting to the United States\n\n## Preparing for Your Trip to the United States\n\nBefore you leave for the United States, familiarize yourself with the [different kinds of documents](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/student-forms) you might need. It is always a good idea to carry your original documents with you at all times. Do not put them in your checked baggage.\n\nIt is also a good idea to make at least two sets of copies of these documents: one copy to leave with your family before you depart and one copy to give to your school officials. Here is a list of the important immigration documents:\n\n- Passport;\n- [Visa](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study/student-visa.html \"(opens in a new window)\"); and\n- [Form I-20, \"Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.\"](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/student-forms?form=Forms_I-20)\n\n## Arriving in the United States\n\nArriving in the United States should be a smooth experience if you have everything ready.\n\n## Form I-94\n\nThe [Form I-94, \"Arrival/Departure Record\"](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/student-forms?form=Form_I-94) is a critical record. It shows that you have been legally admitted to the United States, the class of admission, and the authorized period of stay. It is very important that the information on the record is correct. Inconsistencies between the information on the Form I-94 and Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records can reduce the chances of a successful systems interface. In particular, this can cause issues with status verification for Social Security numbers.\n\nIf you arrive by a land port, you will receive a paper Form I-94. If you arrive at the port of entry by air or sea, an automated Form I-94 record will automatically be generated for you by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers. CBP will provide you with an admission stamp on your passport that is annotated with date of admission, class of admission and admitted-until date. The electronic arrival/departure record can be obtained at [www.cbp.gov/I94.](http://www.cbp.gov/i94 \"(opens in a new window)\")\n\n## Secondary Inspection\n\nIf the CBP officer at the port of entry cannot verify your information, or if you do not have all of the required documentation, a CBP officer may direct you to an interview area known as [secondary inspection.](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/what-is-secondary-inspection)\n\n## Form I-515A\n\nIf you arrive at the U.S. border without all the necessary paperwork, CBP officials may issue you a [Form I-515A, \"Notice to Student or Exchange Visitor\".](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/student-forms?form=Form_I-515A) To learn more, visit [What is a Form I-515A?](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/515a)\n\n## Reporting to your School\n\nYou have 30 days to enter the country before your official program start date, which is recorded in [SEVIS.](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/sevis) You must report to your school by the program start date listed on the [Form I-20](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/student-forms?form=Forms_I-20) you received. This is one of the rules you agree to when you received your student or exchange visitor status. If you do not follow this rule, you are not [maintaining your status.](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/maintain-your-status)\n\nIt is best to contact your school immediately after entering the country so that there is no question of your arrival.\n\nIf you cannot enter the United States for the term listed on your [Form I-20](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/student-forms?form=Forms_I-20) or if you will be late by a few days, immediately contact your designated school officials so that they can accurately enter this information in your SEVIS record.\n\nRelated Tags: [Travel](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/filter?filter=59)\n\nStudent Resources Navigation\n\n- [Get Started](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/travel/getting-to-the-united-states)  -
